Exploring the basics of Git and GitHub

# Lucie Steigleder, Web developement Intern

> Still trying to figure out what I want to do when I grow up, I have too many ideas: I started with biology, especially animal behaviour; ~~I can’t necessarily explain why your cat always tries to eat your plants, but~~ I can talk about weird animal facts for hours.  This is why I shifted to scientific communication: to be paid to continuously talk and share about science. The widest and most used platform to convey information being the internet, website development is my next challenge!

## Things I look forward to
[ ] Finishing a first (big) project

## What I like about Teamwork
~~~
- Synergy -> how several minds together go further than if they were isolated
- Mental stimulation -> how other people thinking open unexpected doors
- Mutual help -> how you always have someone to put you back on track if you get lost
